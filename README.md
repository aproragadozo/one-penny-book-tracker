# one-penny-book-tracker
Beginnings of web app to monitor the price of books on amazon, and notify users when price drops below threshold.

Using Flask and SQLAlchemy and Marshmallow so far for the backend.

JWT for user authentication.
Basic Flask-Mail config for sending forgotten passwords.

No frontend yet - expected to be based on scraping Amazon product pages instead of going through their API as it's constantly changing and requires user to be an amazon retailertehmeslves for access.
